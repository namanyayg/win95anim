# Win 95 Commercial's logo animation in pure CSS and HTML

## What is this?

It is the [Windows 95 Commercial](http://goo.gl/Bes8Z)'s logo, made in pure HTML and CSS. A lot of CSS3 features were used. It's open source, and [on GitHub](http://github.com/namanyayg/win95anim).

## Who made this?

I, [Namanyay Goel](http://namanyayg.com/), made this. When I'm not <strike>wasting my time on stuff like this</strike> experimenting with new technologies, I design and develop websites for myself and my clients. [I'm on Twitter](http://twitter.com/namanyayg), too.

## How did you make this?

By using _a lot of _CSS3 animations and transforms. I'll be [blogging about this](http://symmetrycode.com/) in a while, so keep an eye. I also used Lea Verou's [-prefix-free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/), which was immensely useful to save my sanity.

Basically, made it for a learning experience, since I pretty much needed an excuse to play with CSS3 animations and transforms.
